# Dynamic-Graph-Isomorphism

Overview:
 In this project, I collaborated with a teammate to analyze football passing strategies using concepts from temporal subgraph isomorphism. We modeled passes between players as a dynamic graph, where nodes represent players and edges represent time-stamped passes. Our goal was to detect recurring subgraph patterns that indicate effective team strategies. We posted our research and implementation in two phases on YouTube as part of our project presentation.
What We Implemented (Phase 1):

ðŸ”— Phase 1 â€“ Data Pipeline & Graph Modeling

Understood the research papers by Oberoi et al. (2023) and Bourgeais et al. (2023).

Transformed a real football passing dataset into the format required by Oberoiâ€™s code (nodes, edges, time-stamped attributes).

Created a snapshot-based graph model capturing team dynamics across different time intervals.


What We Implemented (Phase 2):
ðŸ”— Phase 2 â€“ Pattern Detection & Team Comparison

Used the provided algorithm to detect frequent isomorphic passing patterns.

Identified key subgraph motifs (e.g., triangles, chains) and their frequency over time.

Compared passing strategies between two football teams by analyzing the appearance of similar graph structures.


Research & Insights:

Found that some team formations repeated specific passing motifs under high-pressure scenarios.

Verified that consistent subgraph patterns can signal well-coordinated gameplay.

Visualized and compared structural similarities between teams using methods shown in research figures.
